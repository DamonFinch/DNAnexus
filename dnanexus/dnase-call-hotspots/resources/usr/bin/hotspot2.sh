Usage:  $0 [options] in.bam outdir

Options:
    -h                    Show this helpful help

  Mandatory options:
    -c CHROM_SIZES_FILE   (lowercase 'c')
                          File containing the lengths of all chromosomes
                          to include in the analysis, in BED or starch format.
                          All start coordinates (column 2) must be 0.
    -C CENTER_SITES_FILE  (uppercase 'C')
                          File of mappble sites (1bp each) where cleavages
                          observed at mappable sites within a radius of
                          NEIGHBORHOOD_SIZE bp will be tallied
                          and used to call hotspots of cleavage activity.
                          IMPORTANT: The user needs to create this file
                          using the script extractCenterSites.sh before running
                          $0, and the same NEIGHBORHOOD_SIZE
                          must be specified for both scripts.

  Optional options (note distinction between 'f' and 'F'):
    -M MAPPABLE_REG_FILE  (uppercase 'M')
                          The file of mappable regions that was used
                          to create the CENTER_SITES_FILE.
    -n NEIGHBORHOOD_SIZE  Local neighborhood size (100)
    -w WINDOW_SIZE        Background region size  (25000)
    -m MIN_HOTSPOT_WIDTH  Minimum hotspot width allowed (50)
    -p PVAL_FDR           Number of P-values to use for FDR (1000000)
    -P                    Write P-values to output file, in column 6 (not written by default)
    -f HOTSPOT_THRESHOLD  False-discovery rate to use for hotspot filtering (0.05)
    -F SITECALL_THRESHOLD False-discovery rate to use for site-call filtering (0.05)
    -s SEED               Set this to an integer for repeatable results

    Neighborhood and window sizes are specified as the distance from the edge
    to the center - i.e, a 100bp neighborhood size is a 201bp window.

    The site-call False Discovery Rate threshold (-F) must be greater than or
    equal to the hotspot FDR threshold (-f).  After successful completion of this script,
    the user can, if desired, efficiently call hotspots at any threshold value
    HOTSPOT_THRESHOLD < x <= SITECALL_THRESHOLD without re-running $0,
    via the script hsmerge.sh. It is generally recommended to set SITECALL_THRESHOLD
    to the lowest value at which you might to investigate hotspots, e.g. 0.05 or 0.10.

# To combat issues awk sometimes has with numbers below 1e-300,
# we parse the FDR initially as a string, and assume anything below 1e-100
